# 🗓️ LeapCheck
LeapCheck checks whether a year is a leap year or not.

## 🧠 How it works:
It just simply checks for remainder when year was divided by four.

  -If remainder is zero it is a leap year.
  
  -Else not a leap year.
  

## Example
```cmd
  ---- LeapCheck ----
  1. Current Year
  2. Custom Year
  3. Exit
```
### 1.Current Year:
```cmd
  2025 is not a Leap Year
```

### 2. Custom Year:
```cmd
  Enter the year: 2016
  2016 is a Leap Year
```
